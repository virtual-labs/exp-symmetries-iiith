### Procedure
In this experiment, the user is expected to show the various symmetries that closed packing lattices exhibit. In this experiment, there will be four standard lattices and they are - Simple Cubic, Face Centered Cubic, Body Centered Cubic and Hexagonal Closed Packing.
The steps for the experiment are as follows
- The user can choose which lattice they want to work with from the dropdown in the interface.
- The "select atoms" is a toggle switch that enables users to select atoms. 
- If one atom is selected, the symmetry being checked for will be center of symmetry. If two atoms are sleected, the symmetry being checked will be axis of symmetry. Similarily if three atoms are selected, plane of symmetry will be checked.
- The "Check symmetry" button can be used to evaluate the correctness of the choice made.
- If one atom is selected while clicking the "Check Symmetry" button, it treats the selected atom as the user's choice for the center of symmetry for the given lattice.
- Similarly, if two atoms are selected, then it treats the axis made by them as the user's choice for axis of symmetry and for three atoms as the user's choice for plane of symmetry for the given lattice. 
- However, there are visualization tools to help the user to visualize the symmetry before locking in their choice.
- When one atom is selected and the "Point Symmetry" button is clicked, the lattice is displaced with the selected atom being considered as the center of symmetry.
- When two atoms are selected, the user can use the slider on the interface to see the rotation of the lattice with the axis made by the two selected atoms as the axis of symmetry.
- When three atoms are selected and the "Plane Symmetry" button is clicked, the lattice is displaced with the plane made by the three atoms as the plane of symmetry.

### Note
Some lattices have atom sizes smaller than the theoretically proven ones to help with better visualization for the user.
